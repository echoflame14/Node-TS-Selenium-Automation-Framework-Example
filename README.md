# Node-TS-Selenium-Automation-Framework-Example

 Setup:

 Open your terminal

 cd into the directory this file is in

 run 'npm install' (assuming you have node installed, if not then please download it from this link: 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/')

 run 'npm start' to build and execute the suite. Normally there would be a config file passed that would allow the user to specify which suite they want to run but I tried to simplify this as much as possible so it just does the one suite as is.

 Find the results of the run under the 'logs' folder in this folder.
